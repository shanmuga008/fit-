# Healthy Habits - A Full Stack Fitness Tracker App
---

This application allows users to register and login to a Healthy Habits account. A user's BMI and daily EER and DRI requirements are calculated (based on USDA guidelines) upon registration which are reflected under their personal dashboard. Food and exercise goals are then added under the Food and Exercise tabs. User's can edit their settings which will be reflected back to their dashboard and goals. Food consumption and exercises can be tracked under the Exercise and Food tabs which will be recorded under their goals. Users can then choose to share their progress which will then be reflected under Shared Updates. Goals will decrease as users meet them. 

Users can also search for other users and add them as friends. A request will be sent which can be found under Pending Requests. Once accepted, friends can be found under Friends. Friends can view each other's shared progress.

This app utilizes the MEVN stack - MongoDB, Express, Vue.js and Node.js.

For Project Setup, read the README.md file under the client folder.
